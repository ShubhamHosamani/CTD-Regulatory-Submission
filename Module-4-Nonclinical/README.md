# Module 4 – Nonclinical Study Reports

## Overview
Module 4 contains nonclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetic,
and toxicology study reports that support the safety of a drug
product.

## Regulatory Context
This submission represents a **generic drug application**
prepared in the Common Technical Document (CTD) format.

## Typical Contents of Module 4
In a full submission, Module 4 may include:
- Primary pharmacodynamics
- Secondary pharmacodynamics
- Safety pharmacology
- Pharmacokinetics (ADME)
- Acute toxicity
- Repeat-dose toxicity
- Genotoxicity
- Reproductive toxicity (if applicable)

## Waiver Justification
For generic drug products, nonclinical studies are generally
**not required** when:
- The active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) is well established
- The route of administration is unchanged
- The dosage form is the same as the reference listed drug
- Bioequivalence to the reference product is demonstrated

## Conclusion
Based on international regulatory guidelines (ICH and FDA),
nonclinical studies are waived for this generic drug application.
This module is included to demonstrate CTD structure and
regulatory understanding.
