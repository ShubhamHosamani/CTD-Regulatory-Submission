# Module 5 – Clinical Study Reports

## Overview
Module 5 contains reports of clinical studies conducted to
support the safety and efficacy of the drug product.

For generic drug applications, full clinical efficacy studies
are not required. Instead, bioequivalence studies are conducted
to demonstrate therapeutic equivalence with the reference
listed drug (RLD).

## Regulatory Context
This Module 5 is prepared for a **generic drug submission**
following the Common Technical Document (CTD) format as per
ICH and US FDA guidelines.

## Clinical Study Strategy for Generic Drugs
The clinical requirement for generic products is fulfilled by:
- Bioequivalence (BE) studies
- Comparative pharmacokinetic evaluation
- Waiver of extensive clinical trials

## Bioequivalence Study Description
A randomized, open-label, single-dose, two-treatment,
two-period, two-sequence crossover bioequivalence study
is conducted in healthy adult volunteers under fasting
conditions.

### Key Pharmacokinetic Parameters
- Cmax (Maximum plasma concentration)
- Tmax (Time to reach Cmax)
- AUC0–t (Area under the curve up to last measurable time)
- AUC0–∞ (Area under the curve extrapolated to infinity)

## Bioequivalence Acceptance Criteria
Bioequivalence is concluded if the 90% confidence intervals
for the Test/Reference ratio of Cmax and AUC fall within
the regulatory acceptance range of **80.00% – 125.00%**.

## Clinical Waiver Justification
Based on the demonstration of bioequivalence to the
reference listed drug, additional clinical efficacy and
safety studies are not required for this generic product.

## Conclusion
Module 5 demonstrates that the generic drug product is
bioequivalent to the reference product and can be considered
therapeutically equivalent as per regulatory guidelines.
